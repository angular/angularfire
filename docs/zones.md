# Zone Wrappers

AngularFire wraps the [framework agnostic Firebase JS SDK](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk) and [RxFire](https://github.com/firebaseextended/rxfire) to ensure proper functionality in Zone and Zoneless applications alike.

These wrappers ensure Firebase APIs are called outside of the Angular zone. This isolates side-effects such as timers so that they do not destabilize your application. 

Observables, Promise-based APIs, and those with callbacks will purposely destabilize your application until a initial value is returned, this ensures that server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG/pre-rendering) wait for data before rendering the page's HTML.

## Consequences of not Zone wrapping

When using a Firebase or RxFire API without importing from AngularFire or if AngularFire APIs are used outside of an injection context you _may_ experience instability.

instability can be difficult to track down ([see Resolving zone pollution in the Angular docs](https://angular.dev/best-practices/zone-pollution)). To help with debugging, AngularFire emits warnings when it is unable to Zone wrap an API while in dev-mode. **Often these messages can be safely ignored** but we'd rather be verbose.

When an application is unstable change-detection, two-way binding, and rehydration may not work as expectedâ€”leading to both subtle and non-subtle bugs in your application. Further, server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG/pre-rendering) may timeout or render a blank page.

There are a number of situations where AngularFire's Zone wrapping is inconsequential such adding/deleting/updating a document in response to user-input, signing a user in, calling a Cloud Function, etc. So long as no long-lived side-effects are kicked off, your application should be ok. Most Promise based APIs are fairly safe without zone wrapping.
