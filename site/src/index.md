## What is AngularFire?

AngularFire smooths over the rough edges an Angular developer might encounter when implementing the framework-agnostic Firebase JS SDK & aims to provide a more natural developer experience by conforming to Angular conventions.

### Dependency injection
Provide and Inject Firebase services in your components

### Zone.js wrappers
Stable zones allow proper functionality of service workers, forms, SSR, and pre-rendering

### Observable based
Utilize RxJS rather than callbacks for realtime streams

### NgRx friendly API
Integrate with NgRx using AngularFire's action based APIs.

### Lazy-loading
AngularFire dynamically imports much of Firebase, reducing time to load your app

### Deploy schematics
Get your Angular application deployed on Firebase Hosting with a single command

### Google Analytics
Zero-effort Angular Router awareness in Google Analytics

### Router Guards
Guard your Angular routes with built-in Firebase Authentication checks
