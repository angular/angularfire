- Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular (include the firebase and angularfire tags, too!)

Have a feature request?

Great, we love hearing how we can improve our products! Remove the template below and
provide an explanation of your feature request. Provide code samples if applicable. Try to
think about what it will allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current
